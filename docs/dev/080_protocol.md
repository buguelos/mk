Protocol
====================
WhatsApp uses some sort of customized XMPP server, named internally as FunXMPP,
which is basically some extended proprietary version.

Authentication
---------------------
WhatsApp uses JID (jabber id) and password to successfully login to the service.
The password is generated by the server and received upon registration.
The JID is a concatenation between your countryâ€™s code and mobile number.

Multimedia Message sending
---------------------
Photos, Videos and Audio files shared with WhatsApp contacts are HTTP-uploaded to a server
before being sent to the recipient(s) along with Base64 thumbnail of media file (if applicable)
along with the generated HTTP link as the message body.

Files are stored within /upload directory which should be public accessible

Each file is stored in /upload/{messageId % 100}/{messageId % 100}.{realFileName}
